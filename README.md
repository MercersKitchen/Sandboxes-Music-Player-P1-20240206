# Progression
- [x] Website Option for Promotion, Marketplace
- [x] GitHub Repository ( i.e. github.io ) and Submission through Google CLASSROOM Google FORM
- [x] Start Processing IDE, Introduction to Buttons, etc.
- [x] Create Processing Boilerplate for Android Development (Interactive Visually-based Program) & ID Java Compiler Folder
  - Global Variables, setup, draw, keyPressed, mousePressed, End
- [x] Google Search of Music Player Images ( must end with IMAGE.fileExtension like IMAGE.jpg, etc. )
- [x] Upload of Paper Case Study | Downloaded Image
  - Purpose: must know what music player looks like because when we start to think like a computer it is easy to get lost "in a forest of detailed trees"
  - Graphical User Interface (GUI)
  - Starting Place, not ending place
  - See Mr. Mercer's Google Drive for Paper Images (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zW66hJX31XduL0i_nGVJh15geNLlsdV8) 
- [x] (100% Assignment, must be done or cannot compile code) Installation of Minim in Processing.pde IDE
  - File-Sketch / Import Library / Manage Library / Contribution Manager 
  - Verify Minim is installed as a "Contributed Library"
- [x] Upload of Music & Sound Effects (.mp3 is Internet Standard)
  - Minimum 3 songs, max 5, see https://studio.youtube.com/channel/UCkhFasU2ZSgusy_b1l4bcHg/music
  - Minimum one sound effect, max 5
- [x] All text on Case Study typed into ReadMe.md file and spell-checked
- [x] HelloWorld: println(), print(), display key variables, concatenation, inspecting variables, character escapes, display geometry, ternary operators
- [x] Drawing Rectangles: using Case Study, strongly formatted languages, variable types & casting, reading code like a book
  - "A computer knows where the CANVAS is, where the mouse is, and cannot learn to put these together"
  - "A developer makes common sense or intuitive experiences"
  - "Developer must know what goes in these rectangles"
  - Layout DIVISIONS of a page
  - Local Variables for calculations, garbage collection
  - Global Variables for memories
  - background rect(), variables, using inequalities to create a button, WINDOWS System Activation of Canvas or fullScreen()
  - foreground rect() and QUIT Button
  - Primitive Variables, location-name and value: integers (int & long), decimals (float & double)
  - CAUTION: these rect()s get TURNED OFF, except for the Quit Button
  - Note: background(color) is same as background rect() without variables for button
- [x] Creating DIVs: from Case Study, paper folding activity & record DIV Ratios, rect(), variable names, the populate ratios of Display Geometry
  - Quick activity: copy 3 rectangles from your Case Study (one image, one 2-D shapes, & one text)
  - Follow demo on developing ratios: fractions, percent, or referent measure & area calculate
  - Use counting of fractions and decimals to "move rectangles" (easier method is mid-pointing and multiples of 1/2)
  - Use Percent as a fraction: easier overall method since denominator is 100, numerator can be guessed
  - [OPTINAL] Use area calculations and referent measures with FOR Loops (See Demonstration by Mr. Mercer)
  - [OPTINAL] Use Linear Algebra or Calculus (Able to talk with Mr. Mercer about developing this method)
- [ ] Hackathon: Grade Progress of DIVs
  - Reminder: 2-day hackathon
	- #1: copy rect(X, Y, Width, Height) for each rectangle of GUI (Number from Case Study must be known)
	- #2: name rect() variables according to type of rectangle on GUI
	- #3: copy variables to Global Variables to initialize these on the hard-drive
	- #4: Population: Typing Magic
	- #5: Population: copy display-variable (i.e. appWidth & appHeight)
	- #6: Population: use fraction | percent | formulaic method using area referent measure to develop ratio of display
- [ ] Develop the Attributes of the QUIT Button, paper only
  - Rectangle: two rectangles giving depth
  - Image v 2D shape (two lines) v Text
  - Text: QUIT v Hover-over "Close" Pop-up
  - Features like hover-over to change the rectangle fill and ink
  - Colours: blue light affects our eyes over time and our brains specifically at night
	- Daytime: Light Mode v Dark Mode (limit blue light in white colour as a area calculation)
	- Night Time: Limit all blue light (yellow on black)
  - Student Choice: find a night mode colour for Purple (high level of blue light content)
  - Teacher Choice of Colours: count in Tools / Color Selector
	- Black: #000000
	- White: #FFFFFF
	- Purple: #FF00FF
	- Yellow: #FFFF00
	- Daytime, Dark Mode: White on Black (no limit on blue light)
	- Daytime, Light Mode: Black on White (no limit on blue light)
	- Nighttime, all: Yellow on Black, all other colours can must limit blue light
- [ ] Demonstrate Code for Exemplar Quit Button
  - Text Prototyped in Static Program, Copied to Dynamic musicPlayer: learn about boilerplate sections
  - NOTE: actual text incorporates colours from above creating effect with hoverover
  - Drawing in draw(), Boolean update in draw()
  - Trigger: mousePress
  - Confirmation: hover-over
  - Action: Close WINDOW, End Program
  - Advanced: save program state for next execution ()
- [ ] Mini Hackathon: Text Assignment: static program, bottom footer repeating the header-title
- [ ] Grade interactive design of Quit Button (template for all buttons)
- [x] Sound for QUIT Button, see mousePressed
  - [x] delay based on real crystal time (see CS20 Time keeper, create a prototype for this)
  - [x] using TAB to copy and paste code
    - VOID in MAIN Program
	- VOID in TAB: Music TAB ( note: copy global variables, setup() and draw() later )
  - [ ] OPTIONAL: delay based on second(), see delay and second code in Processing.org / Reference
- [ ] Grouping: DIVs, easier to find and add to
  - Global Variables
  - rectSetup() listing of all rect() to visualize DIVs
  - able to turn these off automatically 
- [x] Code for Timer, required to pause for sound effects, introduction to a listener from draw(), and a Boolean
- [x] Images, Prototyping Program: Background for Day Mode (Light or Dark Mode) and Night Mode
- [x] Images, Prototyping Program: example Key Bind for User Preference between Day Mode's Light and Dark Mode
  - CAUTION: Dark Mode is safer
  - NOTE: the current Market Place Folder is in Light Mode, so it needs to be asked for
- [ ] Images, Music Program: Background Image Choices
- [ ] Images, Music Program: Foreground Image (Image for One Song, Groove.mp3)
- [ ] 2D Shapes, Music Program: GUI Music Player Buttons and Other Buttons as needed

- [ ] TBA

### Ideas

- [ ] initiation, declaration, naming, and values
- [ ] TBA
- [ ] Combining single line IFs to IF-ELSE to correct problems of appWidth&Height equaling zero and breaking the app
- [ ] Compound AND OR conditionals the same as nested IFs
- [ ] Example Feedback statements needed display is too small for minimum CANVAS size
- [ ] Program must be in fullScreen() when deployed
- [ ] Purpose: using rect() parameters as variables in "divisions of page" metaphor leading to advanced Geometry Ratios, buttons, text, and images code
- [ ] Exemplar is static and flat (comments will point toward dynamic sections)
- [ ] CAUTION: might start with pixel numbers related to size() as if on a modified coordinate plane, BUT, ratios are better (see paperfolding lesson by Mr. Mercer)
similar to DIV's in website design
- [ ] Introduce separation of initiating & populating variables
- [ ] Introduce color variable, hexadecimal, RGB Notation, random feature with inequality boundary, and IDE Color Sector
- [ ] IDE Color Selector: Tools / Color Selector
- [ ] Note about learning the hard way: video explores typing and reading in code, what different parameters to, and curiosity in prototyping a section of code
- [ ] Note about primitive-version-control: these are "snapshots" of what coding a prototype might look like
- [ ] Visualizing where text will be located with a rectangle
- [ ] Choosing a font and size
- [ ] Choosing ink
- [ ] Simple Typography choices (see Processing.org / Reference / Search Typography for other choices)
- [ ] Debugging "white space" inside the font to choose a font size based on Display Geometry
- [ ] Pick a screen size & orientation
- [ ] Draw a rectangle in the middle of the canvas
- [ ] Add hardcoded and random colours
- [ ] Introduce dark & light Mode
- [ ] Introduce Night Reading Mode
- [ ] background()
- [ ] stroke(), noStroke()
- [ ] strokeWeight()
- [ ] fill(), noFill()
- [ ] random()
- [ ] Single Line IF to make choices about code to run at specifies times
- [ ] Night Mode happening at night or toggle button

- [ ] ADVANCED: auto reading list of music in folder containing music, see Intermediate or Advanced Memories

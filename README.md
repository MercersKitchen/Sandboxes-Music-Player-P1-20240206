- [ ] TBA

# Progression
- [x] Website Option for Promotion, Marketplace
- [x] GitHub Repository ( i.e. github.io ) and Submission through Google CLASSROOM Google FORM
- [x] Start Processing IDE, Introduction to Buttons, etc.
- [x] Create Processing Boilerplate for Android Development (Interactive Visually-based Program) & ID Java Compiler Folder
  - Global Variables, setup, draw, keyPressed, mousePressed, End
- [x] Google Search of Music Player Images ( must end with IMAGE.fileExtension like IMAGE.jpg, etc. )
- [x] Upload of Paper Case Study | Downloaded Image
  - Purpose: must know what music player looks like because when we start to think like a computer it is easy to get lost "in a forest of detailed trees"
  - Graphical User Interface (GUI)
  - Starting Place, not ending place
  - See Mr. Mercer's Google Drive for Paper Images (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zW66hJX31XduL0i_nGVJh15geNLlsdV8) 
- [ ] (100% Assignment, must be done or cannot compile code) Installation of Minim in Processing.pde IDE
  - File-Sketch / Import Library / Manage Library / Contribution Manager 
  - Verify Minim is installed as a "Contributed Library"
- [ ] Upload of Music & Sound Effects (.mp3 is Internet Standard)
  - Minimum 3 songs, max 5, see https://studio.youtube.com/channel/UCkhFasU2ZSgusy_b1l4bcHg/music
  - Minimum one sound effect, max 5
- [ ] All text on Case Study typed into ReadMe.md file and spell-checked
- [ ] HelloWorld: println(), print(), display key variables, concatenation, inspecting variables, character escapes, display geometry, ternary operators
- [ ] Drawing Rectangles: using Case Study, strongly formatted languages, variable types & casting, reading code like a book
  - "A computer knows where the CANVAS is, where the mouse is, and cannot learn to put these together"
  - "A developer makes common sense or intuitive experiences"
  - Local Variables for calculations, garbage collection
  - Global Variables for memories
  - background rect(), variables, using inequalities to create a button, WINDOWS System Activation of Canvas or fullScreen()
  - foreground rect() and QUIT Button
  - Primitive Variables, location-name and value: integers (int & long), decimals (float & double)
- [ ] TBA

### Ideas
- [ ] 
- [ ] TBA
- [ ] 
- [ ] Purpose: using rect() parameters as variables in "divisions of page" metaphor leading to advanced Geometry Ratios, buttons, text, and images code
- [ ] Exemplar is static and flat (comments will point toward dynamic sections)
- [ ] CAUTION: might start with pixel numbers related to size() as if on a modified coordinate plane, BUT, ratios are better (see paperfolding lesson by Mr. Mercer)
similar to DIV's in website design
- [ ] Introduce separation of initiating & populating variables
- [ ] Introduce color variable, hexadecimal, RGB Notation, random feature with inequality boundary, and IDE Color Sector
- [ ] IDE Color Selector: Tools / Color Selector
- [ ] Note about learning the hard way: video explores typing and reading in code, what different parameters to, and curiosity in prototyping a section of code
- [ ] Note about primitive-version-control: these are "snapshots" of what coding a prototype might look like

- [ ] ADVANCED: auto reading list of music in folder containing music, see Intermediate or Advanced Memories

- [ ] TBA

# Progression
- [x] Website Option for Promotion, Marketplace
- [x] GitHub Repository ( i.e. github.io ) and Submission through Google CLASSROOM Google FORM
- [x] Start Processing IDE, Introduction to Buttons, etc.
- [x] Create Processing Boilerplate for Android Development (Interactive Visually-based Program) & ID Java Compiler Folder
  - Global Variables, setup, draw, keyPressed, mousePressed, End
- [x] Google Search of Music Player Images ( must end with IMAGE.fileExtension like IMAGE.jpg, etc. )
- [x] Upload of Paper Case Study | Downloaded Image
  - Purpose: must know what music player looks like because when we start to think like a computer it is easy to get lost "in a forest of detailed trees"
  - Graphical User Interface (GUI)
  - Starting Place, not ending place
  - See Mr. Mercer's Google Drive for Paper Images (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zW66hJX31XduL0i_nGVJh15geNLlsdV8) 
- [ ] (100% Assignment, must be done or cannot compile code) Installation of Minim in Processing.pde IDE
  - File-Sketch / Import Library / Manage Library / Contribution Manager 
  - Verify Minim is installed as a "Contributed Library"
- [ ] Upload of Music & Sound Effects (.mp3 is Internet Standard)
  - Minimum 3 songs, max 5, see https://studio.youtube.com/channel/UCkhFasU2ZSgusy_b1l4bcHg/music
  - Minimum one sound effect, max 5
- [ ] All text on Case Study typed into ReadMe.md file and spell-checked
- [x] HelloWorld: println(), print(), display key variables, concatenation, inspecting variables, character escapes, display geometry, ternary operators
- [ ] Drawing Rectangles: using Case Study, strongly formatted languages, variable types & casting, reading code like a book
  - "A computer knows where the CANVAS is, where the mouse is, and cannot learn to put these together"
  - "A developer makes common sense or intuitive experiences"
  - "Developer must know what goes in these rectangles"
  - Layout DIVISIONS of a page
  - Local Variables for calculations, garbage collection
  - Global Variables for memories
  - background rect(), variables, using inequalities to create a button, WINDOWS System Activation of Canvas or fullScreen()
  - foreground rect() and QUIT Button
  - Primitive Variables, location-name and value: integers (int & long), decimals (float & double)
  - CAUTION: these rect()s get TURNED OFF, except for the Quit Button
  - Note: background(color) is same as background rect() without variables for button
- [ ] Creating DIVs: from Case Study, paper folding activity & record DIV Ratios, rect(), variable names, the populate ratios of Display Geometry
  - Quick activity: copy 3 rectangles from your Case Study (one image, one 2-D shapes, & one text)
  - Follow demo on developing ratios: fractions, percent, or referent measure & area calculate
  - Use counting of fractions and decimals to "move rectangles" (easier method is mid-pointing and multiples of 1/2)
  - Use Percent as a fraction: easier overall method since denominator is 100, numerator can be guessed
  - [OPTINAL] Use area calculations and referent measures with FOR Loops (See Demonstration by Mr. Mercer)
  - [OPTINAL] Use Linear Algebra or Calculus (Able to talk with Mr. Mercer about developing this method)
- [ ] Hackathon: Grade Progress of DIVs
  - Reminder: 2-day hackathon
	- #1: copy rect(X, Y, Width, Height) for each rectangle of GUI (Number from Case Study must be known)
	- #2: name rect() variables according to type of rectangle on GUI
	- #3: copy variables to Global Variables to initialize these on the hard-drive
	- #4: Population: Typing Magic
	- #5: Population: copy display-variable (i.e. appWidth & appHeight)
	- #6: Population: use fraction | percent | formulaic method using area referent measure to develop ratio of display
- [ ] Develop the Attributes of the QUIT Button, paper only
  - Image
  - Text
  - Features, like hover over
  - Additional 2D Shapes
- [ ] TBA
- [ ] Rectangles that do not go away - what is the code for these
- [ ] Code for Timer, required to pause for sound effects, introduction to a listener from draw(), and a Boolean
- [ ] TBA

### Ideas

- [ ] initiation, declaration, naming, and values
- [ ] TBA
- [ ] Combining single line IFs to IF-ELSE to correct problems of appWidth&Height equaling zero and breaking the app
- [ ] Compound AND OR conditionals the same as nested IFs
- [ ] Example Feedback statements needed display is too small for minimum CANVAS size
- [ ] Program must be in fullScreen() when deployed
- [ ] Purpose: using rect() parameters as variables in "divisions of page" metaphor leading to advanced Geometry Ratios, buttons, text, and images code
- [ ] Exemplar is static and flat (comments will point toward dynamic sections)
- [ ] CAUTION: might start with pixel numbers related to size() as if on a modified coordinate plane, BUT, ratios are better (see paperfolding lesson by Mr. Mercer)
similar to DIV's in website design
- [ ] Introduce separation of initiating & populating variables
- [ ] Introduce color variable, hexadecimal, RGB Notation, random feature with inequality boundary, and IDE Color Sector
- [ ] IDE Color Selector: Tools / Color Selector
- [ ] Note about learning the hard way: video explores typing and reading in code, what different parameters to, and curiosity in prototyping a section of code
- [ ] Note about primitive-version-control: these are "snapshots" of what coding a prototype might look like
- [ ] Visualizing where text will be located with a rectangle
- [ ] Choosing a font and size
- [ ] Choosing ink
- [ ] Simple Typography choices (see Processing.org / Reference / Search Typography for other choices)
- [ ] Debugging "white space" inside the font to choose a font size based on Display Geometry
- [ ] Pick a screen size & orientation
- [ ] Draw a rectangle in the middle of the canvas
- [ ] Add hardcoded and random colours
- [ ] Introduce dark & light Mode
- [ ] Introduce Night Reading Mode
- [ ] background()
- [ ] stroke(), noStroke()
- [ ] strokeWeight()
- [ ] fill(), noFill()
- [ ] random()
- [ ] Single Line IF to make choices about code to run at specifies times
- [ ] Night Mode happening at night or toggle button

- [ ] ADVANCED: auto reading list of music in folder containing music, see Intermediate or Advanced Memories
